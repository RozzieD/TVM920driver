***This moved 1.1mm displayed 
now, $02817000 is 42037248 decimal, or, divided by what we got for 10um jog (displayed)  $0400 = 1024  is 41052
if 1.1mm is 42037248, then it is 38215.68 ticks per um
hmm but in low it was 102.4 ticks per um...

machine appears steady state.
position readout appears to be (X pos on status is at 0x28) 00 01 68 00 decimal   = 92160

soo....... so 1024 in X is about 83.78um a tick.

******
the tick count given in the FAST command for a fixed amount of movement appears to be a different scale 
to that for LOW SPEED movement.
But the STATUS packet reflects a fixed difference

the status packet has the SAME tick=distance etc count as the LOW SPEED control packet.

in byte$2c, 02 has appeared....
ok, so what is different here is in byte $0d, we have $4, so that is 00 00 34 00
so motion STATUS  is in bytes c,d,e,f ,  for nozzle 1 A axis

a bit longer, status reports

hmm $19 is now in byte $A... 00 19 00 00but was same for different rotation nozzle 2 ?????
also clear that nozzle rotation is LSN of byte $2

< right,  we are now at 360 deg which is in bytes 10..13 and is 00 19 00 00  = >1638400 decimal, 
which is proportional !!! IE yay 1638400 is 360 deg,....

HMMM but the 36 byte command was for  00 19 00 00  for small rotations or large rotations
so is this speed  sensitive / time sensitive?????

how about nozzle 4 for a good measure ?
we went 111.60 deg

< after homing, it looks like this >

the display says X = 465.00 Y = 444.69
translating the hex is 01 64 EC 00  =23391232  and 02 54 88 00 = 39094272 which is inline with y ticks being different

now, we are homed and head is REAR and far RIGHT , and notice that byte 8 is now 0xe0 , not 0xa0

lets spit out a homing again...

As viewed on the gui we triggered the home detectors a few times

0030   02 02 00 00                                      ....

byte $8 is now 0x80 , when NOT homed it is 0xe0 so we have two bits 0x1 and 0x2 for home detectors
we also have bytes $21 and 22 20 to 323 are nozzle 3/4Z homing appears in bytes $20..23


during homing, sttaus :

when it is done with homing, it seems to use a command to tell the TVM where it is, IE what the abs coordinates are.
it might do this with the 08 command
